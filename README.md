# GTA5 Saver  
中文文档:https://github.com/Baugle/Menu-Saver/blob/main/ReadmeCN.md  
Read: add the header file in the part of the menu that is started (e.g. DllMain) and call the function ReadUIIni(); at startup.  
Save: add header file UIManager.hpp, call, for example, g_UiManager->SaveIni();  
You can save the config that setted in the menu.  
It uses ini to save the configuration.  
You might change a few things, like variable names, which I know won't give you much to work with.    
Enjoy your menu!
